# Cosmos Project

This project is a simple web application that uses data from an open API to display information about spaceships, planets, and provide general information about the project. The web application consists of four pages:

- **Home Page** — greeting, logo, and menu.
- **Spaceships** — displays a list of spaceships with details about each.
- **Planets** — a gallery with detailed information about planets.
- **About** — information about the project itself.

The project uses:

- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamically fetching data from an open API.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **API: SWAPI** (Star Wars API) for fetching data about spaceships and planets.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting.
